# Final Assignment

Dear course participants,

The final assignment for this course is to analyze a real `RNA-Seq` dataset, from retrieving the data all the way to enrichment analysis. You have been randomly assigned a publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (`GEO`) dataset. You can also suggest a dataset if you have one, but send me the raw data and get my permission.

You will need to understand the biological context of the experiment, the experimental design, and the data itself. You will need to perform quality control, pre-processing, mapping, and differential expression analysis. As a bouns round you are encourged tow also perform functional enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes.

You will need to submit a single zip file with a main Jupyter notebook with your analysis. The notebook should be well-documented and should include all the code you used to perform the analysis. It should include markdown cells with explanations of the steps you took and the results you obtained. You should also include the figures and tables you generated in the notebook or with Markdown tags for the images. The notebook should be self-contained and should not rely on any external files. It should include both `bash` and `Python` code. Follow the instructions and expand the [template.ipynb](template.ipynb) file.

**The final assignment is due on 01.06.2024. Please submit your notebook via Moodle** Submissions made after this date will not be graded. Submissions delivered to my mailbox will not be graded.

#### **Important notes:**
* Submit a single zip file with name `<your first name>-<your last name>.zip`. If you worked in a group, submit a single zip with all your names on it as such: `<first name1>-<last name1>_<first name2>-<last name2>.zip`. For example: `hadas-volk.zip` or `hadas-volk_moshe-perez.zip`.
*  any redirection to data, figures, code or anything else outside the notebook will result in lowering of the grade. **The notebook should be self-contained completely.**
*  you can work in small groups (up to 3 students) on this assignment. If you choose to work in a group. You will all receive the same grade.
*  Consider using proper Markdown cells and syntax to make your notebook readable and understandable. The nicer your notebook looks, the easier it will be for us to grade it. [Markdown tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook)
*  You can include `bash` commands in your notebook by using the `!` prefix. For example: `!ls -l`


### Good luck!
