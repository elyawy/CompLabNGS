3. You read the following sentence in a paper: *"The 139.5 Mb genome of the fruit fly D. melanogaster was sequenced at approximately x41.35 depth, using 38,454,212 million paired-end Illumina reads.‚Äù* Can you tell what read length was used?
   * 150
   * 75
   * 200
   * 100
   * Impossible to tell

4. In which of the following situations would you use NGS (mark all that apply)?
   * A project involving whole genome sequencing of 10 fish species
   * Comparing expression levels of all genes between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of a bacteria
   * Sequencing a plasmid to check if cloning was successful
   * When diagnosing a patient for celiac disease, checking the existence of a specific allele known to cause the disease.
   * Determining the number of chromosomes in a unicellular algae.

5. Which of the following is an advantage of the Illumina technology over Sanger sequencing?
