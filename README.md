# CompLabNGS
Welcome to TAU Life Sciences - Computational Lab in Next Generation Sequencing and Genomics Data Analysis - 0411358701

Course material will be updated weekly prior to our Sunday session. Make sure you grub necessary slides, data and class/HW assignments from the relevant directory.

Course announcements and HW submissions will be delivered via the course's [Moodle site](https://moodle.tau.ac.il/course/view.php?id=411358701) **only!**

Please use the *Issues* tab above to ask questions and report problems. Your questions will be answered by the course staff and/or your fellow students. Please refrain from sending us emails regarding course-related issues. Your questions and our answers will be visible to all students. This way, we can avoid duplicate questions and you can benefit from the questions and answers of your fellow students.

## Setting up your environment

Our course is all about hands-on experience with NGS data analysis. You'll need to set yourself up with a Unix-based environment. Please follow the instructions on [0-SettingUp](https://github.com/hadasvolk/CompLabNGS/blob/main/0-SettingUp/SettingUp.md) for possible solutions to this task.
