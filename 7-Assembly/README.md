1. What can you say about N90 of an assembly?
* It is always smaller than N50
* It is always larger than N50
* Itâ€™s a measure of assembly completeness
* The more fragmented an assembly is, the larger N90 would be

2. Which of the following can not be obtained from an assembly process without additional data on top from the reads?
* Pseudomolecules
* Genomic distance estimates between scaffolds
* Contigs
* Scaffolds
* Gaps in the assembly
* Genomic distance estimates between contigs

3. Which of the following is commonly used for QA-ing a genome assembly?
* The reads used for the assembly
* A whole genome sequence of a closely-related organism
* The full transcriptome of the assembled species
* The BUSCO set of the taxonomic group to which the species belongs
* Reads from a closely-related organism

4. What assembly properties are measured by the % of detected BUSCOs and N50?
* Completeness and contiguity, respectively
* Both measure completeness
* Completeness and accuracy, respectively
* Accuracy and completeness, respectively
* Contiguity and accuracy, respectively
* Both measure contiguity

5. What types of data are used in scaffolding?
* Paired end reads
* Mate pair reads
* Single end reads
* Reads mapped to the assembly
* Reference sequence of closely-related species
