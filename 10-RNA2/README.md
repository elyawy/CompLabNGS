# Test Yourself

1. Which of the following is incorrect regarding correction for multiple testing?
* In DE analysis, the number of tests is the number of analyzed samples
* Correction for multiple testing is not necessary when working with small genomes
* Using the Bonferroni correction, adjusted P-values will always be larger than original P-values
* Using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction method, low P-values (high significance) are affected less than high P-values (low significance)
* In DE analysis, the number of tests is the number of analyzed genes
* Correction for multiple testing does not affect L2FC values

2. In a volcano plot, which parts contain differentially expressed genes?
* Upper right and upper left
* Upper right only
* Upper half
* Lower half
* Mid-lower half
* Entire plot

3. You compare gene expression levels between bacteria in room temperature and bacteria under cold stress.Fold changes are calculated as cold/room. For gene A you get L2FC = -2.12 and for gene B you get L2FC = 1.77. In both cases the adjusted P-value is < 0.01. Which of these statements is correct?
* Gene A is down-regulated and gene B is up-regulated under cold stress
* Gene A is up-regulated and gene B is down-regulated under cold stress
* Both genes are up-regulated under cold stress
* Both genes are down-regulated under cold stress
* Gene A is not affected and gene B is up-regulated under cold stress
* Gene A is up-regulated and gene B is not affected under cold stress

4. Which pair of samples is the most similar, based on counts data from four genes? (use the Euclidean distance method)
* Samples 1 and 2
* Samples 1 and 3
* Samples 2 and 3
* Impossible to tell from the data
