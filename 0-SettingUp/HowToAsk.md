# How to ask a technical question

When you run a software for the first time (e.g Linux command or some bioinformatic software), it is very likely that you encounter problems. 

Sometimes you’ll be able to solve them alone, but other times, especially if you’re inexperienced working with command line tools, you’ll get stuck. In these situations, asking someone for help would be a good idea. This document provides guidelines for asking technical questions in a way that will help others help you. Apply these recommendations whenever you submit questions to the course Issues or when asking questions on the web (forums, discussion groups or when mailing software developers). This will greatly increase the chances that you get a quick and useful answer.

## Rule #1: try hard before asking questions.
You are very welcome to ask questions, but do that only after you’ve tried every (reasonable) solution you can think of and you’ve run out of ideas. Then when you ask the question, describe all the things you’ve tried and what happened when you tried
them.

## Rule #2: don’t include irrelevant information.
Only include relevant information in your question. For example, if you’re having trouble running a specific software, you don’t have to explain your whole research project and why you need the software (unless you think it’s relevant). In general, try to reduce your question to the minimum needed for people to help you.

## Rule #3: include all relevant information.
You want to provide question recipients with all the information they might need. This includes:
* Your environment (Operating system, type of machine you’re using etc.)
* Which software you tried to use - name of software and version
* The exact command you ran
* The error message you got or the problem you see in the output
* Information about the inputs - if possible, just include the input files (relevant when the files are small and non-confidential), if not - describe them or maybe
provide the *head* of the file (first few lines)
